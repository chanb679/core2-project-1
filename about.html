      <h2>About Author</h2>
      <p>
        Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986) was an Argentine writer and poet best known for his imaginative short stories that blend philosophy, fantasy, and literature. Though he never wrote a novel, his collections <em>Ficciones</em> and <em>The Aleph</em> made him one of the most influential authors of the 20th century. Borges explored ideas such as infinity, time, identity, and reality through symbols like labyrinths and mirrors. An interesting fact about his life is that he slowly went blind, yet continued writing by dictating his work, even while serving as director of Argentina’s National Library.
